biltong
============

Geometry functions used internally by jsPlumb. Perhaps useful for other people. This is not intended 
to be an exhaustive list of functions: these are things that jsPlumb needs and nothing else.  In the 
interests of avoiding bloat in jsPlumb, it is unlikely that anything jsPlumb does not need will find 
its way into this project.

Biltong can be used both in the browser and on the server, and will register itself as a CommonJS module.

### Usage

All functions are in the global object `Biltong`.  I haven't got around to setting up a build to process the API docs; check the source.



### Changelog

#### 0.4.0

- remove version number from file name
- publish to npm

#### 0.3.0
